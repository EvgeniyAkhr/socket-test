<h3>How to Run</h3>

<h4>Server</h4>
To run the server, use the following command:

```bash
python3 server.py
```

The server will start on 0.0.0.0 and listen on free port by default.

Note: Use the server's output log to find the host and port needed to run the client.

<h4>Client</h4>
To run the client, use the following command:

```bash
python3 client.py {client_id} {host} {port}
```
